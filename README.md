# The Noko API Toolbox

We're really excited about the next version of the Noko API ([https://developer.nokotime.com/v2]([https://developer.nokotime.com/v2])), and we want it to make it as easy as possible to get started using it. That's why we're building a "toolbox" for the new API, which will include samples and other useful tidbits.

The biggest tool is the "Noko API V2.paw" file. This can be opened by [Paw.app](https://luckymarmot.com/paw), which is a fantastic app for testing APIs and generating boilerplate code for an API request.
